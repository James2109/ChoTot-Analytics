"Cho Tot Market data analysis" is a project analyzing the DAU (daily active users) data of the e-commerce website Cho Tot. In this project, we analyze the DAU index based on two product segments, which are GEN (general merchandise) and ELT (electronic products). At the same time, we divide into 3 main fields for analysis: Source (where the DAU comes from), Category (product classification), and Region (area). <br> <br>
